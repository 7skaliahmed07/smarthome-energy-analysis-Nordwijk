The drop rate (e.g., -0.5°C/hour on average) slows as outside temperature increases, with a significant p-value (< 0.05) confirming dependence.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "- All assignment questions were addressed with visualizations and statistical components (ANOVA, regression, correlation, t-test, z-scores).\n",
    "- Key insights include evening usage peaks, higher weekend usage, temperature-dependent heating effects, and device anomaly detection.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: \n",
    "  - Predicted temperatures were approximated using a shifted value; future work should integrate real weather server data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap for Nordwijk).\n",
    "  - Day length calculation in `light_usage.ipynb` was approximated; actual sunrise/sunset data would improve accuracy.\n",
    "- **Future Work**: Incorporate external weather data, refine device anomaly detection with more sophisticated methods (e.g., clustering), and explore additional patterns (e.g., seasonal trends)."
